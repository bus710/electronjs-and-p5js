# electronjs-and-p5js

I am not an IT professional but need to make a simple GUI to provide user interface along with my boards.  
After some research I wanted to give a shot to the combination of Electron.js and P5.js.

## Get Node.js  
  
Node is the framework we have to use and I would like to try the current version.  
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
- After downloading, just run the executable.
  
## Get Visual Studio Code
  
Code became so popular as a proper IDE for various projects.
- https://code.visualstudio.com/
- After downloding, just run the executable as well.
